# CleanPrompt

maybe just for me ,ProximityPrompt's UI is not really clean to my eyes
so I made my own UI and It's looking really nice
It have every feature you would expect from ProximityPrompt
but now the UI is a lot more cleaner

**Here's short showcase of it :**

## Customization

I didn't offer this at all nor have plan to do it right now    
at least you can change some ui componant in the Folder  

if you can script UI and want to make your own  
I also provided a [***template***](https://github.com/Huonzales/CleanPrompt/blob/main/Template.lua) in my Github  
This should get you a faster head start
